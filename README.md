## Server Resources and Performance
Please note that the **server resources for this application are limited. This will result in slower API responses and increased loading times. Due to the free instance, the server might spin down with inactivity. As a result, responses may take 50 seconds or more to be processed**, which is significantly longer than on a well-maintained website.
